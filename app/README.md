Ring Builder app routes

How to open these pages in your dev store:
- /app/grid → Product grid demo
- /app/assets → Asset preview grid
- /app/verify → Setup checklist

Notes
- After creating new route files, restart the dev server: `npm run dev`
- Assets are served from `/public/assets/**` under URLs like `/assets/...`
